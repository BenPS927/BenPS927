## Hi, I'm Ben 👋

IT professional - managing IT systems and improving SEO by day, building automations and websites by night

I'm the IT manager for a recruitment company, now turning my focus optimizing our online presence for the age of AI.

I've spent significant time learning to build automations through script and various no/low code models, and am now movng my focus over to website development. Currently, I'm focused on JS React.
