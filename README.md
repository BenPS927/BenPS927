## Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

IT professional in training - building skills in networking, administration, cloud and automation.
I decided the best way to go from IT illiterate to IT support was to build a lab that simulates the ongoings of an office setting, so I've set up BF Enterprises, my home office simulation. Currently I'm getting hands on with Active Directory, Services, Virtualisation and more.

I also learn by writing, so I'm writing the content for the certs I'm studying into textbooks which can be found here: 

Goal: First or second line support technician
